  <h1 style="color:green">The Three Main Image Formats Used In The World</h1>
  <h2>PNG:</h2>
  <li style="list-style-type:square">Their are two types of PNGs</p>
  <li style="list-style-type:square">PNG-8 is like GIF, with only 256 colors to use</p>
  <li style="list-style-type:square">PNG-24 gives a higher quality on the image and is better at being transparent then a GIF</p>
  <h2>JPEG:</h2>
  <li style="list-style-type:square">JPEG's are great with photographs when there are shadows and other complicated things on the image</p>
  <li style="list-style-type:square">JPEG has a variety on colors</p>
  <li style="list-style-type:square">For JPEG's they only need to be adjusted with the quality of the image shown</p>
  <h2>GIF:</h2>
  <li style="list-style-type:square">GIF only has 256 colors, so they should not be used too much</p>
  <li style="list-style-type:square">GIF's work great when there is not a lot of shading and solid colors are used to fill big spaces</p>
  <li style="list-style-type:square">GIF's are meant to be simple images</p>
